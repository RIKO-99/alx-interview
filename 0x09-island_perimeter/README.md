The Island Perimeter problem is a popular algorithm problem that requires analyzing a 2D grid. 

It can be solved using various approaches such as brute-force, optimization using an intuitive insight, and Depth-First Search. 

Each approach has its own educational value and provides different insights into grid traversal problems.

#### Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D array grid of 0‘s (water) and 1‘s (land). An island is a group of 1‘s (representing land) that are connected either horizontally or vertically. You can assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

#### example
input: 
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]


output :12
